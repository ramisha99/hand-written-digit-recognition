# hand-written-digit-recognition
In this project. I am trying to code a convolutional neural network(CNN)and use it to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST data set.
MNISt is a collection of 70000 handwritten digits split into training and test set of 60000 and 10000 images respectively. 
During this project, I have learned how to work with CNN and train your dataset with Maxpooling, Relu, Softmax, and Batch normalization.
After running this program, it can be seen from the terminal that loss decays exponentially over time and the accuracy goes up to the factor of one. 
In the end, we have the finish epoch is 24 total loss of 2.378 and an accuracy of 0.998.

Thanks to Mr.Phil for his tutorials on this project
